# Control a Raspberry Pi 2 Robot via Microsoft Band

Here's a version of [Microsoft's Windows IoT robot](https://www.hackster.io/windowsiot/robot-kit), with integration to Microsoft Band!

The code is very simple:

1. Pairs to the Band
2. Read accelerometer value
3. Translate that into 8 directions
4. Calls the original direction command

Best tested in this orientation ![](http://i.imgur.com/vVoJ4I4.jpg)
